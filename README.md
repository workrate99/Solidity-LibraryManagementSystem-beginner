# Solidity-LibraryManagementSystem-beginner
implements the mechanism of adding, borrowing and returning a book from the library.
It focuses on solidity concepts like structs, mappings, functions and arrays
deployed it on a sepolia eth testnet steps to do that are:
i. change the environment on remix to injected provider-Metamask, it would then prompt you to connect your wallet
ii. connect your wallet but make sure you have adequate faucets in your wallet this would be used to pay gas fees
    for the transactions you'll be making.
iii. you will be able to view your transactions on sepolia.etherscan.io

also deployed it on the zksync testnet.
